Small program for saving links + comment in a simple way.
Written in php. Data is kept in json (so no database is needed). Bootstrap is used for basic styling.

**Helps to:**
* Save links like bookmarks
* Share URLs between devices
* Collectively share links

**List of updates**

+ Added id attribute to Link object and an option to delete links by link id `date("YmdHis")`.
+ Added random cat fact (using [cat-facts API](https://github.com/alexwohlbruck/cat-facts)) to cheer up my girlfriend because likes cats :)
