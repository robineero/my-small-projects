Small program for saving links + comment in a simple way.
Written in php. Data is kept in json (so no database is needed). Bootstrap is used for basic styling.

Helps to:
* Save links like bookmarks
* Share URLs between devices
* Collectively share links

+ Added random cat fact (using [cat-facts API](https://github.com/alexwohlbruck/cat-facts)) to cheer up my girlfriend because likes cats :)
